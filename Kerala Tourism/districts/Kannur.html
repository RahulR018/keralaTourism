            <!-- <h2 class="h2 display-4 text-center"><strong>(Trivandrum)</strong></h2> -->
            <p class="display-5 text-center lead">Located on the Malabar Coast of Kerala, Kannur (fondly known as
                Cannanore), is a beautiful city bundled with a plethora of sightseeing options like beaches, monuments,
                ancient temples and picnic spots.

                Steeped in the distinctive local art forms like Theyyam, Kannur still has an aura of the bygone colonial
                era. The deep footprints of the Dutch, the Portuguese, the British and the Mysore Sultanate are still
                imbibed into the town and can be witnessed all around. The town blessed with exceptional art of weaving
                that has earned it the title of the land of loons and huge cashew trees perhaps rooted by Portuguese.
                Take an evening stroll near the lighthouse beach or explore the Portuguese history at St. Angelo's Fort
                while you are in Kannur.

                <p class="text-center sightdeets">Tucked away in the verdant greenery of the Western Ghats and soaring
                    at a dizzying altitude of 3500 feet above sea level, Palakayyam Thattu is one of the most beautiful
                    hill stations in the entire state of Kerala. Adorned with luxuriously dense greenery, sky-touching
                    trees and majestic hillocks, the view that Palakayyam Thattu enjoys is one that you will rarely
                    find. Owing to its considerable altitude, this hill station is often visited by low hanging clouds
                    that render the entire atmosphere misty and fresh! The magnificent view of this hillock has made it
                    one of the most popular trekking destinations in
                    the south. Sipping on a cup of tea as you overlook the lavish foliage from the top is truly an
                    experience that you will cherish forever. The entire climb up to Palakayyam Thattu is one that is
                    cradled in the serene laps of nature- tranquil, and untouched by the worries of the world. Visiting
                    this gorgeous hill station and basking in its remarkable view with your loved ones would be a
                    perfect way to escape the monotony of our fast-paced city lives and indulge in some excitement and
                    enjoyment.</p>

                <p class="text-center sightdeets">St Angelos Fort is definitely one of the most popular and frequently
                    visited attractions of Kannur and for more reasons than one. The polished yet prehistoric structure
                    of this fortress oozes with unadulterated elegance and overwhelming power. Standing ashore in the
                    Arabian sea, St Angelos Fort enjoys a panoramic and unobstructed view of the diorama created by the
                    merger of the magnetic waves and the azure waters. It also overlooks the mesmerising Mopilla Bay, a
                    natural harbour.

                    St Angelos Fort is mainly famous for the gripping history and the intriguing tales it has to tell.
                    This fort was a point of interest for many dynasties of domestic as well as the international origin
                    and has seen many bitter battles in the quest to conquer it. The Portuguese Viceroy, Dom Francisco
                    de Almeida had imprisoned his successor, Alfonso de Albuquerque because he did not want to give up
                    the reins of his power. This led to a series of bitter events and conspiracies that have been etched
                    in the history of Portugal as well as Kannur forever. Walking around the walls of this majestic
                    fort, you can almost picture the battles that this fortress has seen.</p>

                <p class="text-center sightdeets">Between the coastal towns of Kannur and Thalassery along the Malabar
                    Coast lies the scenic Thottada Beach. Ideal for sunbathers and those looking to unwind by the beach,
                    this virgin beach remains one of the cleaner beaches of the coast due to being relatively unexplored
                    as compared to the other beaches of the coast that receive more publicity. The cleanliness, solitude
                    and tranquillity are part of the charm of the beach, making it the ideal getaway for anyone looking
                    to escape the noise of the city and reconnect with nature and themselves.

                    The serene vibe of the beach complements the lovely natural elements that form this alluring
                    atmosphere. The clear blue waters of the Arabian Sea crash onto the shimmering golden sheets of sand
                    across this 800-metre stretch, with gorgeous coconut palms towering over the rocks of the shore,
                    coloured between the spectrum of red and black. This beach is also the site where the Thottada river
                    meets the Arabian Sea. Near the beach, the river forms swamp-like areas where one can find some
                    interesting natural diversity. </p>
