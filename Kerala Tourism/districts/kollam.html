                <p class="text-center sightdeets">Jatayu Nature Park is a rock-themed park which got opened on November
                    25, 2017. Built to promote mythology and adventure tourism, the tourism centre boasts of 6D theatre,
                    a digital audio-visual room, cable car and ayurvedic cave resort. It is also a home to umpteen
                    adventure activities including paintball, laser tag, archery, bouldering, rock climbing, air-rifle
                    shooting etc. The primary attraction of the park, however, is the world's largest stone-cut bird
                    sculpture replicating Jatayu, the mythical bird from Ramayana.
                    Being the first of its kind destination tourism initiative, it redefines Kerala's haven! It is
                    conceptualized and designed by the Malayali director Rajiv Anchal and has been constructed in
                    collaboration with the state government. The project is first of its kind with public-private
                    partnership under BOT (Built-Operate-Transfer) model. The concept is to bring art, epic, history and
                    technology together. It is located on the exact same hill where the demi-god Jatayu fell after being
                    defeated by Ravana in a fight to save Sita from his clutches. </p>

                <p class="text-center sightdeets">Voted as the first 'Beach Wedding Destination' in Kerala, the Kollam
                    Beach requires no introduction. This scenic and breathtaking natural wonder is also known as the
                    Mahatma Gandhi Beach and boasts of pristine blue waters that seem to unite with the bright sky at an
                    infinite distance, while tourists marvel at the sheer magnificence of the majestic scene. The Kollam
                    Beach is brimming with a large number of local and international tourists all year round who can be
                    seen enjoying the numerous activities that the beach offers, while also appreciating the enchanting
                    panoramic views of the Arabian Sea. The cultural and spiritual aura of the beach is indeed
                    contagious and fills the visitors with renewed energy and passions.

                    The Kollam Beach also houses the Mahatma Gandhi Park, which was inaugurated in 1961, and has been a
                    significant tourist attraction ever since. The area was formerly a port city and was also the
                    harbour for Chinese ships and trade, and the traces of Chinese commerce can still be seen here. </p>

                <p class="text-center sightdeets">Punalur, lying along the border of Tamil Nadu and Kerala in the
                    district of Kollam, derives its name from two words one Tamil and one Malayalam. Tamil word 'punal'
                    means water and Malayalam word 'ooru' means place together making Punalur the place of water. Indeed
                    Kallada flows right through the heart of the city with the famous suspension bridge hanging over it,
                    stretching for 400 metres across its width. Panalur is known as "Pepper Village of Kerala" and is
                    also houses a major Paper Mill established in 1850's.

                    Panalur has lovely woods of pineapples, coconut and palm trees, cinnamons and other spices and has
                    exciting adventure sports and exotic jungle experiences in the Thenmala Ecotourism Park. Panalur It
                    was the heart of the riots against Diwan back in the days and also the centre of the Keralite
                    industrial revolution that took strength from the establishment of the Punalur paper mills.
                    Historical importance apart, this town is also a proper tourist attraction mainly for the British
                    era bridge and the picturesque beauty all around. </p>
